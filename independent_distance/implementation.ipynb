    "- Jake: Yes, this would be separate from the other models and wou be used for comparisons for the portfolio benchmarking.  tslearn has implementations a lot of these distances (https://github.com/tslearn-team/tslearn/tree/main/tslearn/metrics) which we could use or borrow from.  It might be nice to have a wrapper similar to the pairwise_distance function in sklearn, but for the time series metrics."
