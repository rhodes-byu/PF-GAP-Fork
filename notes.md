# Week of April 3rd
## Tasks 
1. Adapt QGAP to only fit once
2. Take the normal the RF-GAP. Use it for Time Series data (we will need to apply a Multi-ROCKET transform. Works like a convulational neural network. Use a small kernal to limit the feature output)
    a. Look at how to balance the static features (so its not drowned out by the massive amount of output features)
3. Add in other methods to the pipeline one by one. 
    a. Look at FreshPRINCE model next


## Changes and Updates
1. Updated QGAP to fit just once
2. 

## Questions before out meeting
1. Looking at the java code, to run it in python you need the data files. Is that how all of the data we will be given will look like? Sourced in files? Or should I convert the data to a file, and then clean it up. 
    a. I am currently planning on just using the java implementation but wrapping it a little tighter to manage all of the files (whats made throughout the process is deleted), so the code changes will be minimal. 
    b. Also, could you share the data files you have been using?
