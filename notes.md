# Tasks
1. Build out half of a pipeline. 
    a. It needs to take data in, the model (like QUANT or PFGAP) and eventually static variables.
    b. It needs to output the RF proximities in a numpy array. (This assumes the estimator to be a random forest) 
2. Add Static abilities to QUANT. 
3. Add in other methods to the pipeline one by one. 


# Changes and Updates
1. Built out the static variables
