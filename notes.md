## Questions before out meeting
1. Looking at the java code, to run it in python you need the data files. Is that how all of the data we will be given will look like? Sourced in files? Or should I convert the data to a file, and then clean it up. 
    a. I am currently planning on just using the java implementation but wrapping it a little tighter to manage all of the files (whats made throughout the process is deleted), so the code changes will be minimal. 
    b. Also, could you share the data files you have been using?
