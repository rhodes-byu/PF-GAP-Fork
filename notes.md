# Week of April 3rd
## Tasks 
3. Add in other methods to the pipeline one by one. 
    b. **DrCIFClassifier (Intervals)
    c. **RotationForestClassifier (Not a model for Time Series)

## Changes and Updates
1. Updated QGAP to fit just once
2. Created the RFGAP Rocket class
    a. Created the test notebook
    b. Allowed it to compute Static variables as well
    c. Updated Pipeline to take it in
3. Added FreshPrince (though it doesn't work)
    a. However, tsfresh seems finicky and it won't load correctly. 
4. Added RDST
    a. Added Static handling (for the proximities - won't predict with static yet)
    b. Enabled it to work in the pipeline
    
# Week of April 9th
## Tasks
1. Investigating Redcomets extra rows
2. Applying an MDS transform to the proximities and visualizing them as points. 
    a. See what we get. Look at the data integrity. Is there a distinction between the results
    b. We can calculate the outlier scores -> we can plot these as well. (Not necessary)
    c. Run KNN and verify prediction (We would expect a similar score as the forest)
    d. Use the picture -> predictions using raw data
3. Figure out the Java Code.
